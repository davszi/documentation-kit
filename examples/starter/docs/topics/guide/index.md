## Pin the tools, own the content

<p class="bs-lead">A project chooses its shared-kit revision while keeping its pages and configuration in its own repository.</p>

[Figure 1](#fig-pipeline) separates what a project authors from what the kit supplies. The arrows carry inputs into a generated site; editing output does not update either source.

## Let a finding settle into one home

<p class="bs-lead">Move durable knowledge to its subject, keep evidence with its producer, and route unfinished work to its owner.</p>

[Figure 2](#fig-knowledge) shows the promotion path. An accepted design still needs an implementation and evidence before it describes tested behavior.

<p class="bs-lead">Keep design decisions, implemented behavior and runtime observations visibly distinct.</p>

<!-- fold: experiment What a complete experiment records -->

State measured motivation, a strong cheap baseline and acceptance criteria before results. Retain the reproduction command, source revision, environment, input identities, output table with units, verdict, caveats and next step. A failed acceptance check is a result worth preserving.

No benchmark has been run for this starter. These are authoring requirements, not sample performance results.

## Keep the argument visible and depth optional

<p class="bs-lead">A reader should understand the claim and verdict with every supporting fold closed.</p>

[Figure 3](#fig-layers) puts the explanation on the visible path. Math, Experiments, Code and Alternatives add detail without becoming prerequisites hidden from the reader.

<!-- fold: math Count resources without counting copies -->

Let $P$ be the set of resources referenced by pages and $S$ the shared resources needed by the reader. Their union defines the required bundle:

$$
R = P \cup S
$$

A resource used in both sets appears once. This is set notation for packaging, not a measured size or timing claim.

<!-- fold: code Configure the project identity once -->

The first three lines of the starter configuration are a real source excerpt. Replace the example repository before publishing source links; the title and home label are project choices.

```toml source=docs/site/site.toml#L1-L3
title = "Documentation kit"
home_label = "Docs"
gh_repo = "https://github.com/example/project"

## Open a chapter with one slide, then read on

<p class="bs-lead">A slide face summarises its chapter; the chapter remains the complete, readable source of every claim.</p>

Write the face between `<!-- slide -->` and `<!-- /slide -->` at the start of a chapter. The reader shows it as a 16:9 slide at the top of the card, followed by the full chapter. `python docsite.py slides --project . --select guide --out guide` collects the faces into a deck that can be presented or printed.

<section class="card" id="choice">

## Choose shared maintenance with a deliberate update point

<p class="bs-lead">A pinned submodule fits projects that need the same visual language without surrendering their own release schedule.</p>

<div class="scroll" role="region" aria-label="Maintenance options; scroll horizontally" tabindex="0" data-reader-horizontal>

| Option | Shared fixes | Project control | Maintenance cost | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Copy the theme into every project | Reapply each fix separately | Direct local edits | Copies can drift | Suitable only for an intentionally independent fork |
| Pinned shared-kit submodule | Adopt a reviewed kit revision | Content, overrides and update timing stay local | Initialize and review each upgrade | Selected for this starter |
| Independently build each site's engine | No common update path | Complete freedom | Maintain reader, checks and theme per project | Use when requirements differ enough to justify it |

</div>

The verdict follows ownership and update behavior, not a measured speed comparison. Keep a kit upgrade reviewable: change the pin, rebuild the consumer and inspect its actual pages.

<!-- fold: dead-end Why a copied reader creates more owners -->

A local copy can be appropriate for a deliberate fork. It stops being a shared component: fixes to keyboard behavior, deep links and saved reading positions must be integrated independently. Record that ownership decision rather than treating the fork as an automatic shared-kit update.
